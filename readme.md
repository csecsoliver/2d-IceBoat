# It's like boat racing on ice in Minecraft, but in 2D!

You control a boat with arrow keys to finish a set amount of laps asap, while also avoiding falling off the map.

I really did not choose the most efficient framework to work in, as it's not really even a game engine (I really should learn one properly). Anyway, I have finished most of what I planned to implement. I had an idea to add multiplayer, and while it is still a possibility, I haven't managed to do it this week (procrastination got me). 

If you create any proper maps, feel free to open an issue/create a pull request (whichever you find easier), and attach the json. I will definitely add it in a short amount of time, as the current ones are just bad.

What I have used: 
- Pixi.JS
- Victor
